- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheAgaveFairy
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and maybe data engineering; I'm passionate about helping people make informed data-driven decisions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and will start to look at machine learning models when time provides.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not sure yet, new passion and I have lots to become aware of).
- 📫 How to reach me ... jodgey4@gmail.com
